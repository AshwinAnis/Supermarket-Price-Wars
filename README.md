# Supermarket-Price-Wars
This project is a statistical analysis of the prices between Coles and Woolworths, two of Australiaâ€™s leading supermarket chains. This study is to assess which supermarket chain is cheaper than the other based on the mean of the prices of products available at both the supermarkets.
